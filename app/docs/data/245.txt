So, so,

Christopher, in

you've got to have some real good

stories,

something that maybe you've

run across.

And I

would never ask you to name names or

that type of thing,

but in your in

your experience, is there,

is there

a situation that was

just that you'll

never forget that you could share

with us?

Yeah, I'd be happy to.

So I represented a

mobile home community, OK?

And they

had a resident who

we received several

complaints about because she had

several hundred pigeons.

Oh my goodness.

Backyard of her property

in New York.

Well,

they were creating understandable

concerns about livability

for her neighbors.

Noise smell the waste.

Hmm. So we'd received several

complaints from neighbors about

this.

This has gotten out of control.

You know,

we need you to do something about

it.

This is a mobile home park, so

animals are common.

Almost everybody's got some kind of

pet.

Some people have birds or chickens,

and

that's absolutely allowed in this

park.

The problem here is

not the presence of the animal.

It's the No.

Yeah, I've got hundreds of these

animals.

So we contacted the

resident in writing

because this was a potential lease

violation.

So we're very formal from the very

beginning,

notified her of the issue.

We're having these,

these these noise, this smell

as waste disruptions.

We need you to

get rid of or dramatically reduce

the number of pigeons you have at

the property.

She wrote us back a very nice

letter, and it was

one of the reasons besides the

memorability

of so many pigeons.

One of the reasons this

case sticks in my head is

because the disabled

individual,

she did exactly what she should

have done from the very beginning.

She responded to us promptly

in writing and

explained her circumstances.

Her husband had

passed away something that the

owners of

the property knew because he'd been

a tenant

as well had recently passed away

and she was

suffering from depression

because of the loss of her husband.

Something very understandable to

hopefully

to anybody. Yes, she

had, with the support

of her physician, ban

breeding pigeons as

a therapy,

as a coping mechanism for the

depression.

She recognized that it had probably

gotten a little

out of control and

understood her neighbors concerns.

So what she proposed is that she

reduce the number

of animals, but

she could only be reduced to a

certain point because the benefit

she was getting

was breeding of pigeons.

So she was going

to need to coops to separate

the men from

the women and

a certain minimum number of animals,

which might be higher than we would

normally allow.

Given the size of the property

impacts on the neighbor.

So this brought up a bunch of

different things in

really the perfect way.

She explained to us her disability.

We never asked about

the specifics,

the fact that she was suffering from

depression.

That's that's her business.

She's welcome to

volunteer that to us, but it was

very important

that we never asked about that

information

she chose to volunteer.

The nature of her

disability was significant is

that she was disabled

and the causal connection there.

Why does

she need what she needs?

The fact that she

needed multiple animals

is another one that

we see that comes up pretty

frequently.

We get residents who might already

have a

pet and then they want to bring a

second

animal into the property as an

accommodation.

And it's it's a pretty common

gut instinct to say,

Well, why do you need that second

one? Well,

you know, one is the pet and one has

provided

me combinations are totally

appropriate to

have multiple.

And in this circumstance, all

of the animals were part of the

accommodation

because she needed multiple

animals to get

the benefit,

which was the breeding therapy.

So at the time,

you know, the mental commitment that

that

involved doing that, as she also

explained

why it's going to

be a little bit higher, a little

bit more disruptive than maybe you

would

normally allow for that same reason

that

what the benefit I'm getting out of

this is

the breeding activity.

And then she recognized

that it had gotten gotten

unreasonable, that,

you know, 20 birds might be

reasonable, but

200 was was definitely a little

bit, of course.

Yeah, yeah, somewhere in there

as well.

So she agreed to work

on reducing the number of animals.

All she really astro was more time,

and

she explained that to us too is it's

luck.

If I release these

birds, they're just going to

fly back because they think of this

property as home.

Yeah, but I have friends

and connections in

the pigeon breeding community.

I was surprised

to learn that there was such a thing

as I'm a city boy

and I'm going

to reach out to them and

find people who can take

some of these animals

and who can keep them confined.

Long enough

that the the pigeons sort

of relocate what

they

think of as home, so when they're

released,

they don't just immediately fly back

to this property,

but that's going to take some time.

I got to find some people,

they've got to come out and take the

animals

and be ready to haul them, and I'll

be working on this,

but it's going to take a little

while.

So we gave

her time to work on that.

And over the course of

a few months, you know, so this is

an extended amount

of time that it took to allow her to

come into compliance.

In Washington, this type of

violation is normally

allowed 10 or 30 days to

correct the behavior.

So we gave her several months.

So that was

part of the accommodation as well.

We're allowing

a longer amount of time

to come into

compliance with your lease.

But as long as

she kept demonstrating that she was

diligently

working on reducing

the number to reduce

our issue,

which is the impact on other

residents of the property,

then that was that was our

accommodation was

was more time.

And at the end of the day, a few

more animals will be allowed.

So it it's a memorable

story to me because of the nature of

it. But it

also it just brings in so many

different aspects

where people have questions

or concerns

or confusion around housing,

about number

of animals or different ways to

approach accommodations.

How to have that communication

sticks in my head

because of all those different

things.

Absolutely. And it sounds like you

probably got

a crash course on breeding pigeons

at the same time.

I learned a lot of interesting

stuff. And yeah, sometimes you do.

Yeah, interesting.

Well, and that that just really

makes my heart feel good that the

the number one,

the tenant was willing to

discuss it with you and,

you know, not shut

shut the whole situation down,

as I would assume most tenants

kind of tend to

do is when they get some sort of a

a letter

in this way that, hey, you're in a

lease violation,

whether they're whether

they have a disability

and they require that accommodation

or they're just,

you know, as you had mentioned,

abuse in those situations,

it's great that she, you know,

came to you guys

and was really honest.

You were able to work with it

and kudos to the property owner as

well for being

willing to say now,

OK, yeah, we'll help her

work through this.

It gives me hope for

the world.

I think hearing stories like that,

they know that

everybody's working together, you

know?

And you know, again, if if

there is a broker involved

in that type of situation, I

think from the very beginning

it all needed to be documented.

Any conversations

that they had,

you know, it turned out great,

but the document required

or getting that

documentation on those types of

situations,

I'm sure, is going to, like you

said, reduce the

cost for people if a claim

does come about and

save them some time and energy.

So.

So love those stories.

Love the stories that

you had as a as a professional.

And we don't get to hear those quite

very often.

And I'm actually curious real quick

to jump in here.

April on the advertising side, we

haven't talked a lot about that.

We've talked about again,

like we spent

some time on service animals and

those

that's 70 percent of the business.

We talked

about accommodations, modifications

there,

but I know advertising is kind of a

big deal as well.

So when we think about,

I'm curious to know

from your perspective, couple

of things. The first thing is,

have you noticed that

people are just

understanding

the rules better? And still, you're

not seeing many

violations on the advertising side,

which is why

maybe the I don't know, like

the advertising piece

of your business is not as

bullish as some of those

other particular areas.

And then too, are there

lines kind of blurred between

what you can say

as a potential accommodation

as that you're

advertising that might skew on the

fact of a violation?

I'm glad you bring up advertising.

It is.

It's not

something that I've seen personally

a lot lately,

but in terms of statistics, it is

one of those top

three issues where where problems

come up,

most of the problems

we see around advertising

are around misuse of terminology.

Um, code

words about properties

and family friendly or

near a school can sometimes

be a concern

is that you're trying to steer

particular types

of applicants towards or away from

your property

and in designing

advertising for real estate broker.

You know, whether it's whether it's

a listing for a

sale or whether you're looking for

tenants in a rental property.

That's a big part of your business,

right?

As you want to design it to be

attractive, you

want to play up those features

that will

bring the best quality of residence

to your property.

But if you've got, say, a, um,

a very homogenous

community, maybe you've got

a neighborhood

in the city that is is 90 percent

white and that

neighborhood

has its own local newspaper,

as lots of you know, small

communities do it.

Can be a violation

if you only advertise your

listing in that local paper, because

that can be

viewed as trying to target

that, that white group.

So general purpose advertising

is a great way

to and you can use the local as

well, but also

including some general purpose

advertising when

you're putting in your listing

for sale for a vacancy

could be a much safer way

to avoid that

kind of

complaint and then staying away

from specific

restrictions on

in a housing context.

Something

we might see is

Washington has restrictions

on source of income,

so you can't refuse to

accept Section eight Housing Choice

voucher,

for example. So if you put

no Section eight

applicants accepted in your

advertise and

that's a pretty straightforward

violation, you're

explicitly saying you're not

following a fair

housing rule.

More broadly, if you were to talk

about,

say, criminal history, there

are a lot of federal requirements.

There have been for about 10 years

now around

how you consider an individual's

criminal history

when you are considering them for

rental housing.

So we see

folks who say something like no

felons

permitted, that would be a violation

because

that's a blanket rule and

prohibition of those restrictions.

If we take an example, like parking

in rental housing,

it may be that you have a resident

who isn't disabled

when they initially move in

and they're in a car accident,

so they are now temporarily

disabled.

They have to use a wheelchair or

crutches or

have some other type of mobility

restriction that

is hopefully for them, temporary in

nature.

But it could also come and become

permanent.

Something like aging

can impact a lot of people's

mobility,

so they may have been in a

relationship

for years and have never needed

any type of accommodation,

but they're now coming to this

housing provider.

They've had a long time relationship

with and requesting,

for example, a reserve parking

space.

When we look

at these disability requests, there

are two big

categories as you hinted

at in your question there

are reasonable accommodations,

which are changes

in policies or procedures to allow

a disabled

individual to fully benefit from the

housing.

And

there are modifications

which are those physical changes.

The grab bars the wheelchair

ramps, which again

allow a disabled individual to fully

benefit from the

accommodation or from the housing.

Excuse me.

The big difference

is not around how you process,

how you consider whether to grant

that request or

make a different

proposal, a different alternative,

but rather who pays

for that change.

Modifications

are almost always paid for by the

resident, by this

disabled individual.

And accommodations

require

the provider to bear

a reasonable amount of financial

or administrative burden towards

making that.

So

in the parking context

that you asked about, they

may need a reserve parking

spot.

Perhaps you

have a tenant building with 10

parking spaces and

each residence.

Each unit gets one parking space,

but they're not reserved.

It's everybody gets one.

First come, first serve.

So today you may park spot

six and tomorrow you may be parking

that spot to

this disabled individual could

appropriate or

request the nearest

parking spot to the front door

of the building because it's harder

for them to get around.

They have to use crutches that

wheelchair

bear up

to minimize that distance.

Or maybe there's a carve

out for a wheelchair ramp and they

want the spot

closest to that carve out.

So it would be appropriate

for you to reserve that

particular parking spot for that

individual.

That's a change from a usual policy

of first come,

first serve. To say this one

unit or this one person

gets access to this particular

parking spot at all times.

If you have to paint

or put up a sign to indicate that

that's a physical changed your

property, right?

This is paint that wasn't on the

ground for

this is a sign that wasn't up.

So I see a lot of confusion

with housing providers around

thinking that that physical

alteration will.

That means it's a modification and I

can make

them pay for that sign.

But parking is is a big

exception

to that general rule where physical

changes or modifications

but rule changes are accommodations.

Courts around

the country have consistently ruled

that these types of

parking changes, even if they

require some physical work

like painting or adding a sign, are

still considered

accommodations and not

modifications, and therefore

the owner of the property

has to pay for the cost of

putting up that signage.

OK, that makes sense now, if they

were to take it a

step further, say, and the the

the tenant requested

know a handrail from

the parking spot, maybe that's

close enough to their front door.

Maybe then would

that be considered an accommodation

or a modification

handrail is an excellent example

of a modification.

So that's again, that's that

physical change in the property.

These are

usually,

I wouldn't quite say overwhelmingly,

but certainly more than half the

time the resident

will be the one paying for the

disabled individual

will be the one paying for that

change in the property.

The big exception is if you want to

keep it after that tenancy

ends.

So a resident may need to

widen the doorway at

a

grab bar and lower

a couple of cabinets

in the kitchen,

all to accommodate their use

of a wheelchair.

Mm-Hmm.

And you, as a housing provider, you

have a pre

1991 structure, so it's not

necessarily ADA.

It's not built to ADA requirements,

but now you've

got this unit that meets all those

requirements.

You may, as the owner of the

property, think that's great.

Now I can advertise that I've got

this ADA compliant unit.

This is something I didn't have

before. I, as the

owner of the property, think that's

a great value.

I want to keep all these changes

after this resident

moves out. In that case, the owner

of the property

would be paying for those changes

because they've

elected to keep them.

On the other hand, maybe

all they need is a is a grab bar in

the shower, and

for whatever reason, you don't like

that. They're not.

They're not using a wheelchair, but

they've got some

sort of issue or they need that

extra support to be

able to step into the shower.

So you don't

want to keep that.

After the resident moves out

so you can require them to pay

for installation

of that grab bar and then pay for

removal and

restoration of the exterior to

make it put the unit

back into that move in ready, that

sort of as

new condition after their

tenancy ends and

the disabled individual will be

required to bear

the costs of both of those

construction projects.

That's interesting right there,
Christopher,

because

I had a question around like

the scope or scale

of the modification.

Determine who pays.

Like

is there a threshold for any

reason? Or let's

say that modification is shared

among multiple people?

Um, when does something

again? Just when is something,

I guess kind of fall like determine

when

it's going to fall between a

modification? And I

think you said the physical

altercation. And if that

determination is not made until

like after the

resident moves out that says, Hey, I

want to

keep this modification here,

does is there

a reimbursement to the resident if

they paid for it up front?

Or can you kind of talk about

the scale of modifications?

Who pays and when that might

actually shift to a possible

reimbursement of sorts?

Yeah, there are, unfortunately,

with almost

all aspects of fair housing, they're

not hard and

fast rules, but we talk about

sliding scales

and examples to help understand the

concepts.

So your point

about multiple people

using one,

that's a great way to to think about

it. If we

have a component that we're

changing,

that's only benefiting one person.

Pretty good

chance that that person's going to

be required

to bear the cost of that alteration.

But if we have

some sort of change in our community

where

we need to add a wheelchair ramp,

for example,

to the entrance to the building of a

multitenant property,

that is something that much more

likely is going

to be permanent and it's benefiting

several units,

so the housing provider owner

would be paying

for that change.

Another great example you provided

is something inside the unit where

after it's put in,

the property owner decides they want

to keep that change.

So pretty likely that

when the when the grab bar,

when the moved

moved cabinet drawers were

originally installed, the owner's

thinking, You know,

we don't want to keep these, we're

going to have

you change it back when you move

out. But then,

for whatever reason,

throughout the tenancy later on,

after that work is done, they

decided we're going

to keep those.

Maybe it's at move out and we're

evaluating the changes and we're

looking

at decide now, never mind.

We don't need

you to restore this property once

they've decided

that they're going to keep that

permanent change.

They would be the owner.

The housing provider

would be required to reimburse the

resident for those original costs.

That makes sense.

Yeah, absolutely.

So for for brokers or property

managers that are dealing with these

kinds of situations,

assembly they need, all

of this needs to be in writing.

Absolutely.

Do you have any suggestions for,

you know,

the real estate professional,

of course, respond immediately

show that you're making an effort to

meet those requests

in that type of thing.

But as far as getting these

things down in writing, is this,

you know, I'm thinking

this isn't something that they

should be attempting themselves.

This is probably something that they

want

to approach someone like you that

can help

them write up some sort of an

agreement or

a contract for these changes and

who's going

to pay for them if they're going to

be capped or not?

Is that the

initial conversation may very well

be over a

text message or maybe a phone call?

It may be in person.

If you've got a big property,

maybe you come down to a leasing

office and

you're talking to somebody

that's just fine.

The resident can make

their request in any way.

You may even have a

process, a formal process

for a resident to request an

accommodation,

and they don't follow it for.

For whatever reason,

you still have that same obligation

as you

reminded us to promptly respond

to that if you

are immediately granting a real

straightforward

accommodation exactly

as requested.

Maybe

you just doesn't bother you.

I'm perfectly happy to do this.

It seems pretty obvious to me that

this

is an appropriate thing.

It's not going to be

a big burden on us.

I'm just going to let him do it.

I'm not going to worry about it.

That that circumstance

you might not need outside

assistance.

We're just going to do it.

They've asked for it.

We're going to do it. We're
comfortable

with that.

We're not worried about

some other resident complaining.

So we're happy. We're just we're

going

to grant this accommodation.

Some kind of

documentation that is granted

is always a good idea.

In that simple list of scenarios,

you could

just write him a quick letter

responding, Yes,

that's fine. We're going to allow

that using

because animals are such a common

law

and using animals as an example.

If we're

allowing a resident to have an

animal and are

normally pets friendly building,

this is a this

is a dog we'd allow anyway as

a pet,

but we'd require a pet addendum and

a security deposit.

We're waiving those

requirements because this is an

animal

accommodation and not a pet.

So a pet a.

It's not appropriate a simple

email or a

letter to the residents saying we're

allowing you

to have X Y Z dog

as an accommodation to

your disability.

And we're waiving our pet the

pet requirement as far as

a deposit or we're

not requiring you to complete and

sign the pet it

and send that in a letter

to the resident.

Put a copy of that letter in the

file and

you're all taken care of.

On the other hand,

you may have a more difficult or

more complicated

interaction if they make

a request that immediately

doesn't seem to you appropriate

and

you want to deny or

propose an alternative

accommodation.

At that point, you're engaging

in something that's called the

interactive process.

This is an obligation that you have

to engage in

a in a constructive, back and forth

discussion

with the disabled individual to

determine whether

their request is appropriate,

whether an alternative

accommodation would be appropriate

or if there's

no appropriate

accommodation, there would

be nothing that would be reasonable

in these circumstances.

That final one being fairly

uncommon and

usually the result of someone who's

trying to

abuse these protections rather than

who genuinely

needs them is

overwhelmingly some kind of

accommodation is going to be

appropriate in

that circumstance. That

documentation you

talked about becomes extremely

important because

it is demonstrating two

big things. It's

demonstrating that you are following

the

correct procedure, that you're

having these

appropriate discussions, that you're

exploring

these different alternatives and

it's creating

that documentation for you if there

is a complaint

down the road about different

alternatives

that were explored.

So if ultimately you're

not able to resolve it, you're

not able to find an

accommodation that helps everyone,

you're

able to demonstrate what reasonable

things

we did offer and that it was the

resident

who refused an appropriate

accommodation

in those circumstances.

So that documentation

becomes very important in those

types of

circumstance and probably would help

them reduce their risk in those

situations.

Absolutely.

Yeah. And what I talked about

in my introduction about trying

to avoid even

having to respond to a dispute.

If you do get

a complaint and you have all this

written

documentation, that can really be

something

you point to that can

make the investigation

much faster and therefore

cheaper for you

in terms of your time commitment, as

well

as if you have to pay outside

experts like

an attorney, they're going to be

spending less time

on the investigation and that that

saves you in the pocketbook, for

sure. Yeah.

So yes, so all of those times we

said,

document, document, document,

document, everything is.

Yeah, of course. Yeah, but yeah.

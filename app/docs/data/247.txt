And that's so difficult and

understandable,

you do want to be polite to everyone

and

you know, you're not going to share

the same views

with every single client that you

work with.

But in that situation, could she

have handled it

any differently to have avoided

that complaint at all?

Or do you think that that she

pretty much did what she could do

at that point?

You know, I wasn't there.

So I'm relying

on her after the fact memory of what

happened.

But they are the

rules of thumb that I

encourage

people to use are to stick to

factual information

about the property.

Allow the

interested party

potential buyer potential tenant.

Allow them to

ask whatever they want about the

property and

give factual information that you

know if they ask

about the school district.

If you know,

100 percent positive that

someone who lives

at this property is going to go to

this elementary school,

you could share that information.

But more likely,

these boundaries change all the time

and you

want to point him to where they

can look that up

or simply say, I don't know

if they are engaging

in that kind of that small talk.

You know, be polite,

but try to keep it

within the limits of that

good business

that you do of building a good

rapport.

Try to keep

it factual and targeted

towards what do they want

to know about the property that I do

know that I

can tell them that sticking to that

factual information,

avoiding as much as possible, asking

questions

of the interested

party, the potential buyer,

the potential applicant that

because they can

construe that they might construe

that as discouraging.

You know, if you

accidentally wander into that realm

of talking about members of the

military and

they think you are

disfavored towards them,

they could have that impression.

So sticking

with talking about the property,

letting that

interested party be the one leading

the conversation, asking the facts.

So, so yeah, I don't agree with

them. So she

probably handled it in the best way

that she could,

especially because so often those

types of situations

tend to really surprise us.

We don't know quite what how to

handle it.

People say the darndest things.

Indeed, indeed.

And so direct.

Just a couple

more questions for you, Chris.

I was in a

situation once when I was still

managing sales

where I had a wonderful couple,

great great

people that I loved working with.

We were working on a property.

We were deciding

whether or not we were going to

submit an offer

on the property, and they asked

me specifically

if there were a lot of Chinese

people that have

moved into the area.

I honestly was shocked that

I was even asked that question.

And I quite

honestly did not even know how to

respond.

And so my response to them was,

I'm not sure

because factually I was not

actually sure.

And,

you know, for years and years and

years,

I always wondered, Did I handle

that correctly?

Did I? You know, what could that

have been

a potential violation?

But it sounds like maybe

that was the best that I could have

done is just

that sounds great to me.

Yeah, that meets

my two rules of thumb.

You know, you're letting

them ask the questions.

You're sticking to

factual information if you knew it.

It to him,

but you didn't know.

You know, I don't know

is a is a great way to answer that.

Yeah.

So you had

say you did know, Oh yeah, this

is this is a

real quick growing community

that that's a large

growing

component of of this community.

If you had told them,

yeah, yes, they are, there are that

could be steering,

encouraging Chinese-American

or Asian American

or foreign nationals, even steering

them. Yeah,

it is a great property for you.

You'd love it or

they could have you that hostility.

Not that's not

the kind of community I want to live

in.

They're discouraging me

from renting in this

neighborhood because of that, and I

don't want that.

And that is

a lot of that is on the person

asking the question.

They're bringing their

baggage to that situation.

But if they get

that impression,

that can be what leads to them

making a complaint.

Even if you haven't violated that

time, that expense

of having to deal with that

complaint is what you want to avoid.

So you handled it

exactly how if you could have

frozen time and run to me and asked

how

I would have told you to handle it,

which is now I don't know.

Good, good.

That was that's been a worry

for many years.

So I appreciate your clarity.

So how do you do that?

So for for me,

so that's a great, great example.

But how

do you stay

neutral without

giving the impression

that you're not answering the

question?

So, so for example, let's say you

have a decisive

or someone who's that type of person

is like,

Hey, I need an answer.

I would like an answer

before I move forward in the

process.

I think

that's the approach makes sense

to kind of

stay neutral, if you can.

But how do you

and

how do you avoid like not giving

an answer

that's going to get you in trouble,

but not build

rapport out of salesmanship?

Trying to sell that property.

I try to be familiar with

where someone can get

their sources of information.

Yeah. So now

somewhere you can point them to,

they'll have the answer.

I'm sorry, I don't have that

information for you,

but you know, here's a great

resource that

you could look into to do that.

Maybe a

community center,

a website for a business

or a government organization that

might have it.

What kind of familiarizing yourself

with

some of those areas and where

information

like that might be available?

You're playing

chess with them. You are.

You are a bit,

but you are doing exactly what you

mentioned,

which is trying to build that

rapport. Right?

Trying to seem knowledgeable,

helpful about

the property, trying to get

a potential buyer,

the information that they want to

put in that offer,

because that's at the end of the

day. That's what

you're trying to do is get as many

and as good

a quality offers as you can get as

possible while

avoiding

staying neutral or avoiding

that

information that might be viewed

appropriately,

accurately or accurately as

discriminatory or as as steering

in nature.

Got it!

OK, I know we're getting low on

time.

One more question, I promise.

Burning question

for a lot of us

regarding advertising and

those

code words that you mentioned,

you know,

we've got we've got

HUD that provides us with those,

those words or phrases that we need

to avoid.

We've also got to receive them from

the Northwest MLS.

One question that many brokers

have had

for several years is

the use of the words

family room.

And we've always wondered,

you know, we can't

specifically reference great for a

family, great for a kids.

But yet we're allowed to call a

specific room in a home,

something that technically

could be considered,

you know?

So I wonder if you have any

thoughts on that.

Do you see more terms,

more code words

coming about? Are we going

to start changing the way that we

actually describe the interior of a

home as well?

Well, those resources you mentioned

are really the

the perfect place to look for that.

Yeah, your

local fair housing agency hired

at the federal

level are

great.

In most cases, about providing

that kind of guidance, that kind of

documentation,

many of them maintain

frequently asked

questions on their website.

They can get that

kind of thing.

And that's exactly where I

go to check it

a lot.

Yeah, to make sure that I've got the

most

up to date information because

we all know

from

all sorts of media we consume from

what's happening in society that

these things

are changing a lot,

how people view them,

what is maybe a trigger

for somebody and

what becomes common enough that it

makes

its way into law, something that's

actually

required or prohibited

that grows all the time.

So those most up to date resources

have in

places to look where you can get a

quick

and if not 100 percent definitive,

but very

reliable answer.

That's a great thing to have

is to have resources like that

available to

you, and that's where I would go

to answer that question as well.

That's awesome.

Thank you so much, Chris.

We really appreciate your time with

us.

We hope to have you back again.

And you know,

I wish you all the success in your

business,

although I do wish you don't have to

deal with many of these violations

with brokers.

So, yeah, I'm happy to do

it. I mean, it's really

it's this is such a challenge

in place to run

an effective business that I enjoy

these kind

of opportunities to be able to get

information

out there to help folks

to know, where can I start?

How much of this can I handle my

own?

And when do I need to go out and

get some kind

of third party outside help like a

like a law firm?

And it's it was my pleasure to do

it. Today was

a great conversation.

Happy to join you. Thank you

so much. And real quick before we

leave,

Christopher, would you mind just

telling folks

where they can find you any social

handles?

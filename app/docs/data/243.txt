All right, Chris, well, thank you

for joining us today.

We have our expert in-house,

we have Christopher Cutting,

who is the owner founder

of the cutting law firm.

So Chris

why don't you go ahead and introduce

yourself and we'll dive right in.

All right. Thanks very much for

having me,

and it's great to join both of you

today.

As you mentioned,

my name is Christopher Cutting.

I'm an attorney

practicing real estate

and landlord and tenant law

out of Seattle, Washington.

We have a firm focusing

primarily on assisting

clients with their relationships

between residential landlord

and tenant,

commercial landlord and tenant.

And sort of managing that property.

That brings in for housing aspects

aspects of property management.

And earlier, we try to keep

your business operating

in a way that minimizes

risk of disputes,

as well as the simple compliance

with laws itself.

So, so hiring you, Chris,

would actually help a

broker greatly reduce their

risk if

they're practicing in property

management.

Absolutely. Yeah.

My attitude towards

fair housing

and the practice law in general

is we want to

provide

you with the best possible advantage

legal compliance,

but also in for housing in

particular. Avoid even

the appearance of a violation,

as I'm sure we'll talk about,

even if you have complied with all

the requirements.

If the other party in a transaction

believes you've committed

some sort of housing violation and

they make a

fair housing complaint, you can

spend many,

many hours and thousands or tens

of thousands

of dollars just proving that you are

innocent.

And

there's that comes out of your

bottom line ultimately.

Absolutely.

And not something that a broker

wants to deal with.

And so hiring someone

like you is going to help them

really pay attention to,

especially if they're new to the

property management field.

I think, you know, having an expert

in on their team is

is for sure going to be something

that they need to incorporate.

So, so being in the

position that you are, Christopher,

can you talk to us a little bit

about what are some

of the most common fair

housing issues that you're running

across?

Not necessarily specifically for

landlord tenant law, but in general.

Overwhelmingly, issues around

animals dominate

complaints regarding fair

housing.

That depends

a bit on the city of the state.

You're in the agency

you're looking at, but you can see

70 percent or

more of complaints relate to

issues around animals

interest in a housing

provider that

improperly denied

a request for service

animal in a home or

outside of of housing.

You see, in

what would be a good example,

a grocery store, for example,

improperly if

ejecting

someone because they're using a

guide dog in a property.

Wow.

Wow, I didn't. And now, as far

as the service animals go,

is there, you know,

of course, I'm assuming they have

to carry some sort of identification

with them that shows

that the animal is a service animal.

Is there some,

some some way for them

to indicate to the property

owner whether it be a grocery store,

restaurant

or whatever it is that they're being

kicked out?

How do they indicate to

those owners that, Hey,

I have a legal right to have this

animal with me?

That's a great question, because it

hits on a really

a kind of a fault line, a big

distinction between fair

housing and other types

of Americans with disabilities

act protections you

see in the housing

area.

So this could be a real estate

purchase and

sale transaction over real estate

or when you're

in the business of providing

housing. If you're

a residential landlord, if you

are operating in

Airbnbs in a lot of

states or require

fair housing

will apply their full fair housing

requirements to

an Airbnb because they're not

licensed as hotels.

So we get a bit of a distinction

there. But if you are,

if you are an air carrier and

you're subject to

the air carriers

requirements or if you are

a

commercial establishment like a

grocery store,

then what you're required

to allow the types

of animals you're required to allow

in your

business are much narrower.

It's very much limited,

as you indicated to

specifically things like guide dogs,

which are going to have

identification.

They're not

required to wear those

jackets, but you can see

almost all guide dogs specifically

wear vests.

And that's why, as

a guide, dogs in many, many

circumstances are the only type of

animals that

have to be allowed into property

when we get into

fair housing and

residential real estate.

That's much, much broader, and

there are no

requirements for the animal itself.

So this is

somewhere that if you get a lot of

your information

from the news, the

news is frequently not

because it's not the business that

they're in,

making that clear distinction

between the different

requirements that we see on an

airplane,

for example, versus.

In a rental property.

Interesting, so so basically,

as far as housing goes,

someone who claims that they have a

service animal

doesn't necessarily have to provide

proof or

documentation that that animal is

truly registered as a service

animal, is it?

That's exactly right.

And that's something that HUD has

in the last few years done a lot of

work on as we see

businesses out there, mostly on the

internet, which

will sell you a certificate that

registers an animal as

a service dog.

In the housing context, those

certificates

are completely worthless and those

companies

that are abusing the individuals

and they're abusing housing

providers and real estate owners

because the certificates,

they don't mean anything, but

they're extracting money

from the person who's paying for it,

and they're creating

additional overhead and compliance

issues of getting

people to understand these

differences.

When you

have in the fair housing

arena, when you have an

individual who requests an

animal at a property.

The entire evaluation of

whether to allow the animal

or not is around the individual

who needs that

animal accommodation.

You don't look to questions

about the animal itself

until you've determined

whether the accommodation of

allowing an animal

is going to be granted.

And then does this particular,

this individual animal, have

behavioral problems?

For example, one place where we

see this come

up is areas where

pit bulls might be prohibited.

A lot of rental

properties have rules around certain

breeds

that they don't allow or property,

so they may not

allow pit bulls or pit bull

like dogs.

Mm-Hmm.

An individual that legitimately

needs an animal

to accommodate them in their housing

isn't absolutely

entitled to have a pit bull.

Notwithstanding that

breed restriction that the landlord

might have.

Where you may prohibit

a particular pit bull is

if that individual animal

is shown to have behavioral

propensities that can't be

controlled through some

type of accommodation.

So it may be that we're going

to allow you to have this pit bull

at the property,

but it's been violent towards young

children,

so you need to keep it on a leash at

any time.

It's outside of a controlled area

like your individual unit or your

fenced yard.

Interesting.

Interesting that they would even

allow

an animal like that if there were

issues with

children

leashed or not, it just

surprises me a little bit.

So, so that's really,

really interesting information

and something I'm sure that our

brokers

could provide

to their clients when they're

working with clients

that that have service animals

or what have you.

And of course, you know any

questions they definitely

should be contacting you to to get

some help with that.

Yeah, that just really surprises me.

But so as far as

fair housing issues,

aside from the animals,

you'd

mentioned something else that you

saw that came up kind of frequently

after again, that overwhelming

number of complaints

being related to animals.

The other two real big

issues that come up, the ones that

come up most frequently

turn around advertising sort of

language that

can or can't be included in

advertising.

And

what I've seen a lot more recently

is issues

about parking, providing a reserve

parking spot

for someone with a mobility

disability or issues

around where or how you

sign a disabled reserve,

disabled parking, for example.

Interesting. OK, so so

pay attention, property managers.

This is for you guys

when when you're dealing

with those parking issues.

And we had talked

a little bit about about

this issue, and you'd

mentioned

that sometimes people get confused

with parking

being an accommodation, and that's

not necessarily so.

And when I say accommodation, I

mean, you know,

making sure they have the ramps

installed for them

to access the property and those

types of things that

they put inside the home, the the

bars, the lower

countertops and that type of thing.

So parking isn't

necessarily considered an

accommodation for

somebody with a disability.

And so what would it be considered?

Is this just,

you know, once you get into the

situation

where you've signed a lease and

you're actually

at the point where you're discussing

accommodations

that that tenant may need is

the parking

handled outside of those

conversations before

the lease is even signed?

Or is that something

that they have to work with after

they've

they've decided to go ahead and rent

the property,

and the landlord has said, Yes,

I'm going to rent it to you.

So where at what point is

should some

somebody be talking about their

parking accommodations?

Is kind of my question.

So we see individuals

make accommodation requests,

parking, but but really anything

at a wide range

of

different times in.

Transaction.

It may be when they're

initially inquiring about a property

and they may be

asking about your openness to some

particular change,

or they may wait until after the

leases signed because

they're concerned about

unintentional acts of

discrimination.

Absolutely. So they want to make

sure that they

have their sort of legal

protections in order from

signing a lease, from completing

a purchase transaction.

And then they bring up an

accommodation that

they need and that is entirely

legal as

a real

estate professional, whether you are

a housing provider,

whether you're a broker.

Your obligation is to

promptly

respond to an accommodation

whenever it's made.

You don't have a requirement to

anticipate somebody

making some sort of request.

True. But whenever

it comes in, whether it be part of

an application

process to rent a home, whether

it be in

handling

aspects of a purchase transaction

and someone

needs an accommodation related to

one of

their review

rights at a property, they need some

kind of assistance or a little bit

of extra time to get

access for maybe their five

day walk through

a window on a property.

Your obligation is to

promptly respond to that and

address that requirement.

You can have formal procedures

for and taking

these kind of requests, but

you can.

They can also

come informally.

What's important is that the

individual that needs the

accommodation or

someone who reasonably has the right

to act on

their behalf to make their request

on their behalf,

make that request.

Clearly, they don't have to

use magic language like

I'm requesting a

reasonable accommodation.

But the intent of that request

should be clear.

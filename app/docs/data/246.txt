Have you seen those those

restrictions, if you will,

or things change over time?

Right. So I think

the answer's yes, but also

I'm thinking along the

lines of how how from a property

manager or

property owners perspective,

how do you effectively

advertise without?

Is it the distribution mechanism

like you mentioned, broadening

instead of maybe a local paper?

We already know it's the language,

but

how do you also

kind of can you protect

or can you gear people

towards your community

based on some of those local

amenities,

like a good school district

or those? How

do you broadcast those things when

you

know that's going to attract people

to the

property without

violating fair housing?

Because that's huge in real estate,

as you mentioned.

It is absolutely the first of

all, a real estate location,

location, location right here.

If you're close to

a great school, that can be a really

desirable

thing about a property, but

it might also be seen

as treating individuals

differently based on

family status at the federal level.

We have a

protection for families

with children, so specifically

treating individuals differently

because they

have children in their community

is a form

of discrimination.

It at our state level here

in Washington, we have much more

specific

and more robust protections around

the formation

and the nature of that family group

that are a

little bit little bit more broad.

Where I see

the biggest problems with that and

honestly,

where it's it's even a challenge for

me sometimes

to keep up with what's what are the

latest things

are unintentional, those

indirect things, exactly what you

talked about,

about what we want to promote this

great

amenity around this piece of

property and

trying to think about and use

neutral language

that informs but doesn't

target any particular

group.

Where this classically was an issue

was things

like redlining where you were.

You wouldn't sell

a particular property to

individuals, in particular racial

groups,

but it has grown

or evolved or changed over time.

And a lot of the emphasis now is on

those

kinds of unintentional things where

I'm putting

something in my ad not intending to

discourage any any particular group

from applying.

But that might be construed that

way. If you were

to warn

that it's a walk up, for example,

that could be construed as

discouraging against

individuals with a mobility

disability from renting.

But on the other hand, that's also

probably a really

valuable aspect

to

the piece for me and ABC.

That's a real good piece of
information

that people want to know.

So those are things that

that I try to look up

and find examples on almost every

time

because they do

change.

That unintentional type

of discrimination is probably the

biggest and

fastest area we see changing

in how

these laws are handled and enforced.

There's been no change in that text,

but it's a lot about the spirit of

enforcement that

that I see the biggest changes, the

hardest

things that I as a legal

professional have

trouble keeping up on.

So I would expect

of our brokers out there having very

much

the same issues of, well,

this isn't how it was 30 years ago.

What do you mean?

It's even six months ago sometimes.

Yeah.

Do you find that tenants raise these

complaints

when they don't get the property?

Or how

do these come about to, you know,

get into your scope of business as

well?

The single most common and

a little bit

of it's a little bit unfortunate,

but the single

most common way that I

find clients bring me

these issues when they need my

advice is when

they've been subject to testing

calls.

You may have a city or a state for

housing office

that will.

Using that Section eight voucher

example,

they may call a property

inquiring about a vacancy,

and they'll have sort of a set of

questions that

they'll ask are things that they'll

mention.

And

then an hour later, they'll call

again and

they'll go through very, very

similar script.

But they'll also happen to mention,

Oh, by the way,

I have a housing voucher or

do you accept the

housing vouchers?

And if you treat those

two

different callers differently,

they're going to open.

They're going to make a charge and

open

an investigation for that source

of income discrimination.

And you may find that around

criminal records screening,

you may find it around

really any aspect of fair housing.

And that's where we see a lot of

those as these active

investigations.

But you do sometimes get residents

who were

denied or

who felt like they were discouraged

from even applying.

One thing that I always tell folks

around

that inquiry status is,

you know, anybody

is welcome to put in an offer a

purchase.

Anybody is welcome to apply for the

property,

to rent the property.

I'll give you any information

you want about our process.

You know, if I know it,

if it's factual, I'm happy to give

it to you.

You're welcome to come out, you

know,

take a tour of the property.

Walk around the neighborhood.

It's your decision where you want

to apply or not,

I'm not deciding who gets to apply,

who gets

to put in an offer to purchase this

property.

So just to wrap up on this

whole front, it

almost sounds like what we've talked

about previously,

April, where we're trying to make

the transaction

based on the terms where we've

eliminated

by our love letters and things like

that when it's,

let's say, a purchase transaction.

Question for you,

Chris. Is it more about

the the lines of

ability to pay?

So from the example of this, like we

don't care who you are,

where you come from, can you pay

this rent,

right, regardless of your

background, regardless

of your gender, race

accommodations, whatever?

Can you pay this rental

rate? Is that kind of what

we're what we're moving towards in

terms of the space of fair housing?

It does a lot come down to that.

It comes down

to if it's it's

if it's living in a rental property,

entered into a landlord tenant

relationship,

it's going to be water miscreant

standards.

And do you meet them?

And that documentation,

documentation, documentation

that you

mentioned earlier, as well as

by submitting

an application in

for a rental property.

By running

that screening, we get

documentation of why

we are or aren't entering into

the transaction

with this particular individual.

If it's sale of a property,

it's exactly the same thing

that almost always comes

down to being as simple as price.

But it is.

They put

in an offer and it wasn't

the highest offer, and that's

why I didn't take it.

Or it had contingencies

that this other offer was

close enough on price

and didn't include the contingency.

So that's why

I took this offer over that offer.

But all of that comes

from the documentation.

What the potential buyer,

what potential resident gave

to me, the broker

in the transaction.

And I have that documentation

to point two of I did

this with this person and

that with that person, everyone

could apply.

Everyone could submit an offer.

It's based

on what they gave me, their

application,

their purchase offer that

I made

the decision not based on anything

about them.

OK, very interesting.

So speaking of love letters,

because I know that that's such a,

you know,

active subject right now

and Oregon just having

make it make them illegal.

Do you think

Washington might be following that

that course?

It wouldn't surprise me.

We see on the West Coast,

we see a lot of

this type of legislation where

California

tries out the idea first and

then before we really

know whether it works or not.

Oregon does the same thing.

We like that idea, too.

And then Washington

doesn't want to be left out.

We can't be the only

state on the West Coast that doesn't

do X, Y or Z,

so they may pass legislation

on that as well.

That can happen the other way

around, too.

There are a lot of policies where

let's let's get rid

of some regulation.

Let's open up a market and

California will try it first.

And then maybe it goes

the other way. Maybe Washington

says,

Yeah, let's jump in on that.

But Washington,

Oregon, California, they are they

are very

similar in their attitude

towards a lot of that type of

regulation legislation.

Interesting.

So so be prepared, everybody

out there.

We may not be able to submit

those by your love letters,

which honestly, I don't think we

should in the first

place because, you know, it should

be just about

the property and not the people.

So have you run

across complaints

that have been filed against

real estate brokers regarding

these buyer love letters?

Or I guess it would be complaints

filed against

the seller themselves regarding

the love letter situation?

I haven't seen in a while,

as you indicated,

they're getting to be less

favorable. So I have

not seen in

quite a while a complaint

specifically

about a buyer love letter

where I see them more

as in that same field, though,

is someone who

feels like they were discouraged

from visiting

a property from

making an offer on a property,

whether it's through advertising,

through

phone call that they had with the

broker and

interaction they had when they were

at an open house,

they might overhear a discussion

between

the listing broker and another

interested potential buyer.

And something about the nature of

that conversation

makes them think how I would

be discriminated

against at this property.

So I'm not even going to apply.

I'm not even going to send in my

offer.

I was consulted

on it, but ultimately didn't

didn't get involved in the

investigation,

but I spoke with a broker,

maybe about six months back,

who had received a complaint because

at

an open house, they were

doing what you do,

walking around, showing the

property, talking

to different potential

buyers and.

They were

chatting with a couple about

the

couple had for whatever

reason, they were

not very well disposed towards the

military and

they had made a number of

critical comments

about veterans

and active duty service members.

The couple, the couple did not

the broker.

Okay. I think that's probably the

most important

thing about this example is that

the broker just

kind of wanted to be polite.

You know, these

are possible buyers from my

property. I don't want to.

And so she kind of sort of nods

and allows

them to go on, doesn't join in,

doesn't

affirmatively agree to anything, but

doesn't

get in their face and say, No, no,

no, there's

nothing wrong with members of the

military

or anything like that.

Yeah. So tries to steer

the conversation away to another

topic. They

wrap up and they leave.

While this other

buyer

who was at the open house is

overhears

this conversation

and he gets the impression

that because he's a military member

and part of his,

if he is to submit an offer, he's

going to

have proof that his qualifies for a

Valon as

part of his material that he submits

in his

and his PSA.

And he feels that

if he did that,

he would be denied

even if he had the best price,

even if he had the best offer.

Because this broker,

he thinks is biased

is prejudice against members

of the military members.

The military are

protected class.

Mm hmm. So discriminating

against them as a fair housing

violation,

so he doesn't even put in an offer

and

he makes a complaint against

that broker's license instead.

And that is

that's a great example of an

innocent mistake.

There's no documentation here.

There is no real, even

affirmative act by the

broker other than not going out and

aggressively saying,

No, no, no, no, no, I love

everybody.

Yeah.

Or I treat everybody the same.

Yeah, but the broker

just trying to be polite and

recognizing this

is a fraught conversation and trying

to bring

it to a quick end, but resulted in

this complaint anyway.

Fortunately, there was ultimately no

finding

of any violation by

the broker. Did have to,

you know, spend that time dealing

with

the investigation had to get some

statements

from a couple of people, showed some

examples

of other transactions and

tried to say she was.

She was found not to have violated,

but yeah,

it incurred that burden of having to

go through that investigation.

Yeah.
